    3 generators (all in namespace "gretel")

        initializer:
            generates an initializer for your breadcrumbs (with a file name specified by the
            first argument to the generator) and drops it into your app's config/initializers directory

        partial:
            Drops a partial template ('_gretel_breadcrumb.html.erb') into 'app/views/common' of your app,
            and supporting assets (images and a stylesheet) into appropriate places in your app's assets
            directory tree.  Takes no arguments.

        new:
           Invokes the initializer generator, and then the partial generator.  Takes one argument: the name
           for the initializer file (this gets passed right through to the initializer generator).

Examples:
    (1) rails generate gretel:new breadcrumbs

    This will create:
        config/initializers/breadcrumbs.rb
        app/views/common/_gretel_breadcrumb.html.erb
        app/assets/stylesheets/common/breadcrumb.css.erb
        app/assets/images/common/breadcrumb/breadcrumb_separator.png
        app/assets/images/common/breadcrumb/breadcrumb_bg.png

    (2) rails generate gretel:initializer breadcrumbs

    This will create:
        config/initializers/breadcrumbs.rb

    (3) rails generate gretel:partial

    This will create:
        app/views/common/_gretel_breadcrumb.html.erb
        app/assets/stylesheets/common/breadcrumb.css.erb
        app/assets/images/common/breadcrumb/breadcrumb_separator.png
        app/assets/images/common/breadcrumb/breadcrumb_bg.png
